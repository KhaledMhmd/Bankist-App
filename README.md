# Bankist-App
A website/application where you can access your bank account and do some transactions from it.
It was a project in a javascript course and I tried to create my own copy of it while trying to get the same styling on the original website and I'm going 
to start working on the js code to get it to perform its original functions.
In this website there is a some kind of database (I'm adding it in the code) of a couple of users and throught this website, you 
can manage your bank account and do deposits, withdrawals, request loans, and transfer money to other users.
